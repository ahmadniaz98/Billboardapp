# Billboardapp

This is my first shiny project, this project has two tabs to help visualize data taken from the billboard dataset offered by kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs?resource=download)

There are currently three tabs that extract and visualise data from the dataset
1. Top Songs by Artist

2. Song Progression in the Charts

3. Top 10 Songs (Searched by Date)

Since the chart is updated weekly the app returns the top 10 songs listed closest to the query date.


The app is very straightforward and I hope to add more to it soon.
