# Billboardapp

This is my first shiny project, this project has two tabs to help visualize data taken from the billboard dataset offered by kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/billboard-the-hot-100-songs?resource=download), the app takes an artist as an argument and lists out their best performing songs and takes a song as an argument and plots the chart progression over time.

The app is very straightforward and I hope to add more to it soon.
